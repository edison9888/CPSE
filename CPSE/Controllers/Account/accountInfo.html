    UIWebView has its own private views, which also has gesture recognizers attached. Hence, precedence rules keep any gesture recognizers added to a UIWebView from working properly.
    
    One option is to implement the UIGestureRecognizerDelegate protocol and implement the method gestureRecognizer:shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer. Return YES from this method for other tap gestures. This way you'll get your tap handler called, and the web view will still get its called.
